++
on a recipe details, show the ingredients with upcoming_servings instead of default
user tags
add a user_tag bool to tags. So that when we edit, we can easily remove the
    old automatic tags and keep the user tags
+
import/export
more automatic tagging (prep time, needs heating...)

improvements / bugs
+++
sanitize the tags, removing any unwanted characters (trailing commas, etc...)
++
add some js spices :
    * auto-suggest existing ingredients, units...
    * add some js spices to add more ingredient fields when adding recipe instead
      of the default big chunk of 20 ingredients
allow to not input unit when adding an ingredient
use a NamedTuple instead of a dict to deal with ingredients in non-model form
+
validate recipe name, since it is used for an url (low priority since the app is not
    open to all, we are not as susceptible to bad user input)
prettify the error display when not using wtf.quick_form
current tag approach leads to lots of undesirable tags : Tags(["pasta", "with", "cheese"])
as is, cannot add two recipes in the same db session. Still not sure whether it needs fixing.
when using light theme, screen flashes the dark theme first
